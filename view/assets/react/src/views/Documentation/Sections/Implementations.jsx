                                    fair amount of documentation. Stats Coach is an open source for profit project that highlights.
                                    the uses of C6. I recommend using this as an example to guid your development. Downloading C6
                                    will get you this documentation website in HTML 5 and REACT, whereas downloading Stats Coach
                                    will give you a database connected application in only HTML 5.
