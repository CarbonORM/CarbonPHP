## MVC 

The MVC pattern is a software design pattern that separates the representation of information from the user's interaction with it. The model consists of application data and business rules, and the controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view. The view renders presentation of the model in a particular format.


We have **officially deprecated and removed** the internal functions CarbonPHP had previously used to implement **the MVC pattern**. It's design was based on old PHP syntax and is no longer needed as we have replaced it with a new ORM, or Object Relational Mapping, system. This new system is much more powerful and automates much of the processes you must endure in the MVC design. View the documentation at [CarbonORM.dev](https://carbonorm.dev/) for more information.
