# Front End Development (FED)

C6 is not dependent on a theme; the documentation ships with three leading open source repositories to demonstrate the 
robust use-cases C6 can handle. Generally, I recommend using react for all new projects. Existing HTML/PHP sites my find 
migrating first to PJAX and MUSTACHE template, engine existing in C6 since version 2, be an easier transition to react. 
Note: going straight to react will bare more reward mo' quickly.


## REACT
### Fast User Experience, Cost Effective, Mobile Friendly

Special thanks to Creative Tim and all the ladies and gents contributing to the open source Material Kit and Material Dashboard. My work here is to further the love.

Creative Tim's Material series implementation Material Bootstrap 4 Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. It is based on the popular Bootstrap 4 framework and comes packed with multiple third-party plugins. All components are built to fit perfectly with each other, while aligning to the material concepts.

CarbonPHP expands on Tim's UI by adding the first major login context switch, global sweet alert system, a global axios implementation, and routing chains for easy property scoping.

REACT features a live development server that compiles and refreshes the browser realtime with edits made to the code. I'm my honest opinion, it is a very pleasing development experience that leads to faster overall development process.


## AdminLTE is HTML5 and required Minimal to no Javascript Knowledge

Special thanks to Abdullah Almsaeed and all the ladies and gents working on AdminLTE.

AdminLTE is a popular open source WebApp template for admin dashboards and control panels. It is a responsive HTML template that is based on the CSS framework Bootstrap 3. It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many other commonly used plugins to create a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. AdminLTE is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and built upon.

C6 expands on the AdminLTE UI by implementing Defunkt's jQuery-PJAX, a global alert system, and the Mustache template engine in php and Javascript. CarbonPHP also has Cli support for JS and CSS minification.

AdminLTE is a full scale template system that can handle the UI for most applications needs.
