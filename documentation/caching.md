# Content Caching

**CarbonPHP does not, and will not, cache any data relating to the ORM.** Detailed logging is used, but no repeat results will be dilivered due to a cache hit. It should be noted that [CarbonReact](https://carbonorm.dev/) does implement a stateful caching system built like an in-browers database. Please see the full documentation for the full [CarbonORM Series](https://carbonorm.dev/) here.
