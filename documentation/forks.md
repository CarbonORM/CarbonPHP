# Forks

I plan to write a pnctl library for Windows one day. If anyone would like to help that would be much appreciated. 
Contact me at Richard@Miles.Systems and thank you in advance. Until then forking will only be available for linux and 
osx users. You can use Fork::safe() to help avoid cross-platform issues. So programs simply require the library, such as 
websockets.
